# Code for Taking and transforming Data from Kirtails A - Z Challenge
## What does this code do?
This takes the data from a google sheets page and manipulates it to perfrom analytics on the data. The google sheet link for the A-Z Challenge is [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AGHKXAd4hPa12kvyjAr9WGb4Cm2ZsYNIhiEAj_Hu1Ss/edit#gid=0)
## What do I need to run this?
All the requirements are in the requirements.txt file but this project uses a combination of Pandas and Postrgesql to add things to a local database.
You will need a docker container running for a postgresql database on port 5432 to see the data extracted.
## Why?
Fun project, thought it would be a mini project that I would practice some DE tools with that would take me a day, ended up taking longer and I'm enjoying working on it
